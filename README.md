# Eat Vegan

A website to help track vegan friendly restaurants.

One of the hardest parts of being vegan is finding a restaurant that is vegan friendly. Because of this, I see this as a tool to make a good behavior easier and more sustainable.

Bus apps made it possible for me to learn to ride the bus and make it easier to live without a car. I hope to help others become and stay vegan :)

## How this was implemented
Created CRUD from scratch and implemented bootstrap and simple forms. I need to create more tests but otherwise it's working nicely.
